# Hypothesis-Testing
In this project, I explore whether education affects income by using hypthesis testing concept. I use the "Customer Personality Analysis" data setthat can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis 


Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.


Along the way, I also do descriptive statistics to gain any insights. I use ANOVA test in this project and get conclusion that education has a significant effect on incomes. It shows by pvalue which is less than 5%.
